What is DeepGraph
*****************

DeepGraph is an open source `Python <https://www.python.org/>`_ implementation
of a new network representation introduced
`here <http://arxiv.org/abs/1604.00971>`_. Its purpose is to facilitate
`data analysis <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_analysis>`_ by
interpreting data in terms of
`network theory <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_theory>`_.

The basis of this software package is `Pandas <http://pandas.pydata.org/>`_, a
fast and flexible data analysis tool for the Python programming language.
Utilizing one of its primary data structures, the
`DataFrame <http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.DataFrame.html>`_,
we represent objects (i.e. the nodes of a network) by one DataFrame, and their
pairwise relations (i.e. the edges of a network) by another DataFrame.

One of the main features of DeepGraph is an efficient and scalable creation of
edges. Given a set of nodes in the form of a DataFrame (or an on disc
`HDFStore <http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/io.html#hdf5-pytables>`_),
DeepGraph's :py:meth:`core class <deepgraph.deepgraph.DeepGraph>` provides
:ref:`methods <creating_edges>` to iteratively compute pairwise relations
between the nodes (e.g. similarity/distance measures) using arbitrary, user-defined
functions on the nodes' features. These methods provide arguments to
parallelize the computation and control memory consumption, making them
suitable for very large data-sets and adjustable to whatever hardware you have
at hand (from netbooks to cluster architectures).

Furthermore, once a graph is constructed, DeepGraph allows you to partition its
:py:meth:`nodes <deepgraph.deepgraph.DeepGraph.partition_nodes>`,
:py:meth:`edges <deepgraph.deepgraph.DeepGraph.partition_edges>` or the entire
:py:meth:`graph <deepgraph.deepgraph.DeepGraph.partition_graph>` by the
graph's properties and labels, enabling the aggregation, computation and
allocation of information on and between arbitrary *groups* of nodes. These
methods also let you express elaborate queries on the information contained in
a deep graph.

DeepGraph is not meant to replace or compete with already existing Python
network libraries, such as `NetworkX <https://networkx.github.io/>`_ or
`graph\_tool <https://graph-tool.skewed.de/>`_, but rather to combine and
extend their capabilities with the merits of Pandas. For that matter, the core
class of DeepGraph provides :ref:`interfacing methods <interfacing_methods>` to
convert to common network representations and graph objects of popular Python
network packages.

Deepgraph also implements a number of useful
`plotting methods <https://deepgraph.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api_reference.html#plotting-methods>`_,
including drawings on geographical map projections.

It's also possible to represent :ref:`multilayer networks <tutorial_terror>` by
deep graphs. We're thinking of implementing an interface to a suitable package
dedicated to the analysis of multilayer networks.
